    "So let's assume that we have written a function called, say `answer`, which takes two parameters `n` and `k`, as defined above, and returns the right total minus the left total.  In python the function could look like:\n",

    " * a positive number if the total on the left is smaller than the total on right. <br/>(or think of it as our guess, `k`, for lecturer's house is too far to the left.)\n",
    " * a negative number if the total on the left is larger than the total on right.\n",
    " <br/>(or think of it as our guess, `k`, for lecturer's house is too far to the right.)\n",
    " \n",
    "We want to find integer values of `n` and `k` which returns zero. (Note for any particular value of `n` we have no guarantee that a suitable value of `k` exists, since we are dealing with integers.)\n",

    "Algorithm development is more than just programming &mdash; think painting a picture versus painting a wall. In both contexts you are using the same tools, but the first is an _Art_ while the second is a _Skill_.  At this point you have a lot of the components of the _Skill_ &mdash; you know most of the language syntax and programming constructs (i.e. control blocks, loops, functions, etc.).  So how do you develop the _Art_? This comes with experience, hours and hours of experience. However, you can speed up this process by think on terms of [types of algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_algorithms).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of algorithms that are very suited to computers (and not humans):\n",
    "\n",
    " * Exhaustive search algorithms &mdash; for this problem, this could be implemented as\n",
    "  * we loop over a range of values for $n$ and for $k$ (remember $n\\ge3$ and $1<k<n$) and whenever we find a pair with `answer(n,k)==0` we output message.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    " * Iterative (refining) algorithms &mdash; for this problem, this could be implemented as:\n",
    "   * perform exhaustive search over $n$\n",
    "   * for each `n`\n",
    "     * pick a starting guess for $k$ and use sign on result of function `answer` to lower (or increase) the guess. Repeat until found guess that returns zero or we show no answer exists for this value of `n`. \n",
    "     * Move to next $n$ value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of these two algorithms the exhaustive search is fastest (and easiest) to implement but is typically much slower than a __good__ iterative solution.  The important word here is __good__ &mdash; when including the greater programmer’s development/debugging time the iterative implementation may not be that much faster. Or worse, if the iterative is buggy it might miss a solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Final comment (on this long ramble).  Note the 's' in algorithms in the title. Ths goal of this practical is not realy the solution to the problem, it is to help you develop as a programmer. Always try to devise multiple ways to solve a problem before you start coding.\n",
